## Letmeask
 
<p>This app was developed in a programming course of reactJs of the <a target="_blank" href="https://app.rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a> online school, in the Next Level Week event for programing of all levels.</p>
<p>This app is a SPA bootstrapped with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">[Create React App]</a> and, basically, creates a place that monitors can communicate with their audience in real time while receive questions that are sort by likes / votes by the people in audience in real time, this way, the monitor can easily know what question to answer and to mark it how answered while continue receiving new questions, it is possible to delete an unwanted question or highlight an good question too.</p>
<p>The data is all stored in the firebase realtime database, except by the theme (dark/default or light) chosen by each user, it stay in the local storage.</p>
<p>Originally it was only this, but I decided to insert more functions in it that are next:</p>
<p>Now, the monitors can insert video link of any video providers like youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, twitch and many others, to this, I used the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player">ReactPlayer</a> in a simple but eficient implementation; the users can choose under two options of theme (dark or light), and the layout is responsive now, to be displayed in any format and size screen.</p>
